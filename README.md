# Readme
##Starbax

##### Functionality of package
This package is a collection of scripts and message definitions created to have a Baxter robot prepare a cup of coffee using a single serve coffee maker, one cup, and one single serve packet of coffee. The objects must be set at a specific height and the coffee maker must face Baxter, but objects can otherwise be placed arbitrarily so long as Baxter can easily reach them.

The package uses baxter's in-built inverse kinematics service to move to desired locations. The objective is to approach the objects horizontally and while keeping level, place them at the desired position.

One [launch file][launch] is being worked on so that everything can be started with a single command.


##### [Scripts][src]

* General script facts, warnings and instructions

* [node name][linkid]: What the node does

* Ex: The [wander.py][src-node4] script launches a node that causes the turtlebot to monitor data from its [environmental scanners][src-node4-monitor] for nearby obstacles while moving. If the turtlebot [detects an obstacle][src-node4-stop] within 1.2m or has been moving for 10 seconds it will stop for 5 seconds, spin for 5 seconds, and begin moving in the new direction.




The [pic_cal_sw.py][src-node4] script launches 

The [table_cam_sw.py][src-node4] script launches 

The [starbax_sw.py][src-node4] script launches 

The [artransforms.py][src-node4] script will sunscribe to the ar_pose_marker topic that was generated by the Avlar Marker package. This scrip will then extract the id, the x,y,z , and orientation data of each of the tags and republishes them on the topic ar_pose_id as a custom message type called ar_tag. 

The [pose_and_item.py][src-node4] script will 

The [movement.py][src-node4] script launches 
Breaking the process of picking and place an obect into several small independent tasks, this node defines each of these tasks as a seperate function. The main function calls all of these in the correct order while taking the poses of the objects from the pose_and_item.py node. This information is recieved by the subscribing to the topic "pose_and_item".
The node also calls services to open and close the Keurig lid.


The [open_service.py][src-node4] script launches 

The [close_service.py][src-node4] script launches

##### Topics & Services
* /cmd_vel is the default publish topic for all geometry_msgs/Twist messages in the package. This is appropriate for using with turtlesim, but will not work if launching with Gazebo. See remapping note in the Scripts section.
